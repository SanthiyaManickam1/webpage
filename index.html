    <h1>The Restaurent Menu</h1>
    <p>The short answer is “fewer than you might think”! George A. Miller, a cognitive psychology expert, found that most people can only retain seven pieces of information at a time. That doesn’t mean you should only have seven menu items, but it does mean that you should consider categorizing your menu items and keeping the offerings<br> within each category between three and seven. </p>
